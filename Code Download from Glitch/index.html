              GreenHouse Automate Back ground/project Proposal
            </h1>
            <p>
              This project is to set up a smart polytunnel. Automation of plant
              watering and temp/humidity monitoring, adding camera functionality
              and giving user some data on plant growth vs. climatic conditions
              etc. Rescoped project from original proposal: Camera functionality
              to take a period snap shot, store shot in firebase database,
              inlcude a reference object in background. This database of images
              can then be accessed at anytime and used for postprocess analysis,
              such as comparing temp trends and growth rate and may watering
              amounts. As a cool side effect a time lapse could be made
              filtering out a selecting of images. ALso my web app will take the
              latest snapshot from firebase and display it on screen.
            </p>

              Auto_Watering as planned, user can specify what the dialy water
              dosage is to be via web app, they select 0 if they want it to be
              off, and then 0.5 incements up to 2 litres. The frequency of
              watering is set in Thingspeak time control. Water level in tank is
              also displayed on web app (MQTT to thingsspeak and then iframe
              HTML elememt taken from things speak to web app. The daily ammount
              set is done via html button sending a channel update in
              thingsspeak. The raspberry pi then requests a get url from the
              thingspeak channel fiels taking the last entry and passsing it
              into the watering function. The watering will now use a 12V pump
              activated by a 12V relay normaly open. Conditions set in the
              python software will not allow the pump to be activted if tank is
              empty, and also the user gets a tweet when level is getting low.
              In the python code. The tank is a drum stored inside the poly
              tunnel, as the water can naturally be warmed up creating less
              shock.

              Some research on Tomatoe growing conditions, found that a Vapor
              Presure decifit of 0.9 to 1.2 kPA was ideal growing conditions. A
              calculation channel using MATLAB analysis in thingsspeak can run a
              calculation based on temp and humidity to give the vapor pressure
              decifit output in Pa. The user will be notified when outside this
              range and can then go and act to remidy this.
            </p>

            <p>
              There is automatic vent control, a servo is actiaved and when
              above a temperature threshold. Python code looks after the
              automation, but thingspeak does monitor if vent is open or closed
              (via MQTT). If temp goes further beyond threshold user gets an
              alert and then can take further action, maybe a mist or big fan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Door state is monitored by push button, if the button is activated
              (pushed by door) then a signal is sent with the door state, the
              user can see this on the web app or in the things speak channels.
              If the door is open an alert is also sent to the user, which they
              can ignore if they actually have opened the door.
            </p>

              Arduino not used as originally planned,not neccessary as Raspberry
              Pi has enough GPIO. I have not included scraping weather data. The
              data collected can be used in a database for following year, so
              maybe water ammount required can be estimated. Python used on PI,
              javascript, html and css used in web app and data stored in
              Database

              <h1>What actually is Vapor pressure Deficit</h1>
              <p>
                VPD is the difference between the amount of moisture in the air
                and how much moisture the air can hold when it is saturated.
              </p>

              <p>
                There is an optimum level for VPD,For leafy
                greens and culinary herbs, which prefer a lower VPD, the
                accepted VPD range is 0.65 to 0.9 kilopascal (kPa) with 0.85 kPA
                being optimum. Tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers tend to like it
                drier. The VPD range for tomatoes is 0.9 to 1.2 kPa. For leafy
                greens there is more surface area for moisture to escape the
                plants. The plants like to be in a more humid space so they
                don't release too much moisture too fast.
